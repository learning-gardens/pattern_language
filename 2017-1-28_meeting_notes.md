## Patterns discussed

### #73: Adventure playground

* Solution from book: playground in each neighborhood of raw materials encouraging self-creation from the kids
* [Lady Allen of Hurtwood, “Planning for Play”, 1968](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rbty50hqapmwfmk/PlanningforPlaydownloadablepdf-planning_for_play-order-2017-01-28-882050.pdf?dl=0)
* [AnjiPlay](http://www.anjiplay.com/rights)

### #86: children's home

* Problem from book: looking after kids a deeper issue than "babysitting"
* Solution from book: in each neighborhood, second large rambling home available to kids of all ages, open 24/7
* [Summerhill school](http://www.summerhillschool.co.uk/)

### #75: the family

* Problem from book: the nuclear family is not by itself a viable social form
* Solution from book: empower 8-10 people to come together and set up a communal/multi-family household
* Checkered past w/ commune and cults, but found:
  * [Oneida community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_Community): all the parents took care of all the children; coined the term "free love"; came under fire from wider community for some sexual and parenting practices
  * [cohousing.org](http://cohousing.org/): offer legal guides on how to make this possible, directory of cohousing
* Other lifestyles sort of mirroring collective families:  
  * Mormon polygamy/sister wives
  * Artist collectives
  * Cultures w/ multi-generational households
* Could co-parenting be on a spectrum? Do you need to go full-on commune or could there be a setup where a few houses have a common space between that creates these ad hoc relationships
* A cultural pattern w/ spacial ramifications
* Book doesn't go all in on decentralizing or centralizing: it's a little bit of both

### #80: self-governing workshops and offices

* Several other patterns intertwined (#81: services w/o red tape, for example)
* Problem from book: employees don't enjoy work when they're stripped of agency and community
* Solution from book: worker-owned units of 15-20 people
* Co-op, syndicate
* [Herbert Spencer](http://www.iep.utm.edu/spencer/), economist (and man of good and bad ideas) saw syndicate as evolution of a union
* Family businesses are an example of this
* [King Arthur Flour](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/): over 350 employees and worker owned
* [Anarchistic free school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchistic_free_school)

### 84: teenage society

* Problem from book: modern high school fails to provide appropriate rites of passage
* Solution from book: set up model of adult society where students have adult responsibilities
* Spokane, WA: [City School](http://wvcs.wvsd.org/)
  * Students take on the roles of adult members of community, like police, lawyers, accountants, radio DJs

### 85: shopfront schools

* Problem from book: students need to learn by doing outside the home, build basic skills and learning habits
* Solution from book: tiny, independent schools with 1:10 student ratio, in public areas of community, with a shopfront
* [Riverpoint Academy](http://riverpoint.mead354.org/), Spokane WA: exploratory learning high school
  * 150 students, located in a strip mall
  * Manufacturing space, entrepreneur space
* [Monarch School](http://www.monarchschool.org/), Houston TX
  * Outdoor gardens and learning studios
  * Living building challenge: zero-impact buildings
    * At this studio, children w/ neurological differences take care of different functions of this building
* A school designed by the people who are there. Example: [Deep Springs](http://www.deepsprings.edu/)
